## About the code
You know what they say ... 
Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live .. 

Well in this case it is code first think later so the following principles do not apply:
* Consistent indentation
* Follow the DRY Principle
* Avoid Deep Nesting
* Limiting line length
* Naming conventions
* Use of comments
* Readability
* Any kind of performance

## Disclaimer
Making use of this code will cause, but is not limited to
* CPU Crashes
* Buffer overflow
* Local Fire
* Focal or partial seizures
* Giving up on life
